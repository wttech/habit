= Request processing graph
:description: Request processing graph
:sectanchors:
:page-pagination:

When Habit testing environment receives a test request it is sent to the Apache server within that environment. It is then processed by Apache httpd and possibly forwarded to another server which might be a real proxy or a mock.

Exchange details (request + response) are recorded at each step before being forwarded to the target host.

Together exchanges form a graph representing the way the request has been processed from the original request all the way to the final response returned to the client.

== Deny all requests

Let's image the simplest Apache configuration where 404 Not Found is returned in response to any request sent to `not-found.com` vhost.

.vhosts/not-found.conf
----
RewriteRule ^ - [L,R=404]
----

The request processing graph will contain a root exchange and a single child exchange on the second level.

The root exchange always consists of the original request and the final response.

The child exchange will contain data intercepted by a MitM proxy placed right before the `not-found.com` host.

== HTTPS redirect

If your configuration redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS then the processing graph will be a bit more complicated.

.vhosts/force-https.conf
----
// force HTTPS
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

// deny all HTTPS requests
RewriteRule ^ - [L,R=404]
----

The root exchange will contain the same data but there will be two child exchanges at the second level:

* HTTP request with a 301 response redirecting to HTTPS
* HTTPS request with a 404 response

== Reverse proxy

In a reverse proxy setup Apache is responsible for forwarding requests to one of servers not reachable from the outside world.

The configuration shown below will forward all `front-domain` vhost requests to `back-domain` host.

In Habit testing environment `front-domain` would be processed by a real Apache server while `back-domain` would be a simple mock.

.vhosts/front-domain.conf
----
// forward all requests to back-domain host
RewriteRule (.*) http://back-domain:8080$1 [P]
----

Here the request processing graph will contain three exchanges, each on a different level:

* root exchange stays the same
* `front-domain` exchange contains the original request and the response returned by Apache
* `back-domain` exchange contains the forwarded request (with rewritten URL) and the response returned by the mock server (200 OK with empty body)
